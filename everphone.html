                        <h2>Description:</h2>
                        <p> <span class="bold-text">Everphone is a speculative design project</span> aimed to explore the potential of alternate futures and to provoke thought in those who decide to interact with this project. The <span class="bold-text">main theme</span> of this project is <span class="bold-text">planned obsolescence</span>, with our message being conveyed through a phone kit mockup portraying an alternate timeline of the present where appreciation for material use in our every day electronics are taught at a young age (elementary). We came up with this idea to <span class="bold-text">promote more care and awareness in our objects to prolong its lifespan</span> rather than simply replacing it due to it breaking easily or going "out of fashion".</p>

                        <p>This is the final brochure design, where I planned the layout, picked the overall colour palette and created the isometric phone diagrams.</p>

                        <h2>02. Challenges</h2>
                        <p>The biggest challenge I faced during the project was team management because of all the varying availability my team mates had. Often we would find ourselves meeting together online on Zoom in the evenings every week, which would already be rough since it would be after all of our other activities that would take up the rest of the day (e.g. work, other classes, etc.). I also ran into some issues of some team mates being unresponsive throughout the week to arrange meetings to work on the project together where I tried to encourage more feedback from them, in the end the project managed to come together.</p>
