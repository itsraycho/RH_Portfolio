					<h2>01. Research</h2>
					<a href="img/AnimeExpo_Inspiration.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/AnimeExpo_Inspiration.png" alt="A collage of AnimeExpo branding elements"></a>
					<p>I began this project with looking up Anime Expo and taking a look at their website to see what kind of inspiration and elements I could use for my brochure; this also included observing what existing branding they had. Anime Expo went through a re-branding in 2017 with the help of Studio <a href="https://blind.com/work/project/anime-expo-branding/">Blind</a>, and this is where I borrowed some elements to ensure consistency in event branding and appearance. The font I chose was also inspired by their use of Sharp Sans, so that I could fully incorporate the branding. There was a lot of comic/manga inspired elements they incorporated into their graphic images and banners for websites and printed materials for the event which I included.</p>


					<h2>02. Challenges</h2>
					<p>The main struggle I had with this project was the <span class="bold-text">over abundance of information available for this large convention</span>. Since I only had enough space a standard trifold brochure could offer, I couldn't include everything unless I was making a booklet. The criteria I used to narrow down the info I had gathered was that:</p>
						<ul class="project-list">
							<li class="proj-list-item">a) it needed to explain what the event is</li>
							<li class="proj-list-item">b) how to go and get into the event (price info, map, etc.)</li>
							<li class="proj-list-item">c) what is offered at this event.</li>
						</ul>
					<p>
						Another constraint was that I needed to make sure all the text sizes were still legible despite the amount of info I was trying to include.
					</p>
					<h2>03. Solution</h2>
					<p>For A and B, I was able to easily include said information as the information was a rather small amount that can be included on a single panel. However for C, this convention offered a wide range of events, ranging from big to small. I decided that for the inner panels, <span class="bold-text">I would "highlight" some of the bigger events that happen</span>. I wanted to convey through these smaller bite-size paragraphs that these were some of the more popular events and there were many more that were offered if one were to attend this convention.</p>

					<h2>04. Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, I feel like I did a good job creating this brochure by using elements that reflected Anime Expo's existing branding, and this project looked like it would be something that could be handed out at the actual event. This brochure conveyed all necessary information to a convention goer so that they could attend it with ease, but it also leaves enough room for them to discover sights and events at their own pace. Aside from the design of the brochure, I was also able to gain more experience with designing items for print, creating test prints to ensure nothing was looking different on a physical medium compared to on screen. Everything may look good on a computer screen, which is often the case with digital representations but you won't know what it will be like once you have it in your hands. 
                    </p>
					<p>Looking back at this project now, there are definitely areas of this brochure that could be improved like the Special Guests panel. The way each info block sits feels uneven which is most likely due to </p>
