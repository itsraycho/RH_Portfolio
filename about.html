                    <p>Hey! My name is Rachel and I am a Vancouver-based visual designer aiming to create meaningful and visually pleasing designs through my work. I think it is very important as a designer to have a human-centered approach apart from creating good visuals, as I believe the things we create, in turn will create us.
                    My strengths lie in visual design, particularly in interfaces and publication as they are both mediums that I have an interest in. I enjoy the challenge of finding the balance between great images and well-written copy! I also have an interest in interaction design and enjoy finding solutions for creating a seamless experience for human interaction.</p>
                    <p>In my free time I enjoy spending time with my friends, whether it's getting brunch together or playing games! I am currently working towards a Bachelor of Arts at the School of Interactive Arts &amp; Technology at Simon Fraser University with a concentration in Design!</p>
